# Deep Research Web UI

[English | [中文](README_zh.md)]

This is a web UI for https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research, with several improvements and fixes.

Features:

- 🚀 **Safe & Secure**: Everything (config, API requests, ...) stays in your browser locally
- 🕙 **Realtime feedback**: Stream AI responses and reflect on the UI in real-time
- 🌳 **Search visualization**: Shows the research process using a tree structure. Supports searching in different languages
- 📄 **Export as PDF**: Export the final research report as Markdown / PDF
- 🤖 **Supports more models**: Uses plain prompts instead of newer, less widely supported features like Structured Outputs. This ensures to work with more providers that haven't caught up with the latest OpenAI capabilities.
- 🐳 **Docker support**: Deploy in your environment in one-line command

Currently available providers:

- AI: OpenAI compatible, SiliconFlow, Infiniai, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ollama and more
- Web Search: Tavily (1000 free credits / month), Firecrawl (cloud / self-hosted)
